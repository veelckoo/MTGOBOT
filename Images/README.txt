All the png files in this folder and in the subfolders are required for pattern matching.  They will be used for scannning the screen in order to find a match.

Many of the images should not be tampered with.  Their current height and width are important for the application.

Some folders could be expanded, for example, I am missing some booster packs, and higher numbers.  There are currently no scans of cards because card buying and selling has not been implemented yet.

I don't recommend you change anything in this folder or subfolders unless you know what you are doing.
